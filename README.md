# mod_proxy_gluster

Modified `mod_proxy_gluster` supporting large files, ISO8601 times, and icons
in much the same manner as the normal `mod_autoindex` from Apache. This module
has been tested on both Apache 2.2 and 2.4.

# SYNOPSIS

`mod_proxy` and related modules implement a proxy/gateway for Apache HTTP
Server, supporting a number of popular protocols as well as several different
load balancing algorithms.

This module adds support for accessing Gluster Volumes without the need to
mount them with glusterfs-fuse or NFS. The purpose is to serve static contents.
Files are returned without passing through any interpreters.
`mod_proxy_gluster` is not intended to be used for storing web-applications
(written in languages like PHP).

# DOCUMENTATION

`mod_proxy` and its configuration directives are explained in the Apache HTTP
Server documentation at <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html>.

See the [`mod_proxy_gluster.conf.example`](./mod_proxy_gluster.conf.example)
file for configuration directives.

For allowing unpriviledged users (like a webserver) to access the Gluster
Volumes, some preparations on the Gluster Storage Servers need to be taken
care of:

1. Allow non-root users to connect to glusterd
   In `/etc/glusterfs/glusterd.vol` add this option:
   
   `option rpc-auth-allow-insecure on`
   
   Restart the glusterd service after making this change.

2. Allow non-root users to connect to the bricks in the volume, the example
   below uses the volume called bigfiles
   
   `gluster volume set bigfiles server.allow-insecure on`
   
   Note: Some versions of Gluster require the volume to be stopped and started
   after changing `server.allow-insecure`. Gluster 3.6 and newer should not
   need that.

# BUILDING

There are three ways to build this module:

1. Run `make` and copy the resulting `.so` from the `.libs`

2. Manually run
   
   `apxs -c $(pkg-config glusterfs-api --cflags-only-I --libs-only-l) mod_proxy_gluster.c`
   
   Copy the resulting `.so` file from the `.libs` build directory to the Apache
   modules directory
